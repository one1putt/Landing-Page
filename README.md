Odin Project Foundations Flex Box final project

What: We were giving a jpg of a formatted web page and a list of colors, fonts and sizes to duplicate. since just finished a section on learning flex box, it was implied that this was the basis for the project.

How did I do it?
1. worked from top to bottom and did each section first. I did as suggested and got the content on the page first, then formatted it. this seemed to work well.
2. i included a few pictures to add some color and practice working with them. was good as that was not so easy (see below)
3. if satisfying seeing it come together.

challenges:
1. the pic below the header was tough. I wanted it to be more wide than high. but also to flex in proportion when the window was shrunk. i also wanted it to be able to go taller than the content to its left. and i wanted the pic to be cropped and centered as it adjusted. doing all these things together was a challenge. I was able to get all of these things implemented but....not at the same time.
2. the second challenge was the citing on the quote. in the target it was rt justified below the quote but not quite..since the quote extended. anyway, this was a challenge with the flex properties. I could force it at one screen size but flexing was challenging.
